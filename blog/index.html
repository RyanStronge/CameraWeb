					<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
					<p>The main problem is that the cameras currently used in factories are expensive 'IP Cameras' which have limited functionality, are hard to maintain and are very expensive. I'm trying to find an alternative to these which combat all of these problems.</p>
					<p>The goal of this project is to find a sustainable, cheaper, less time consuming and more powerful alternative to expensive IP Cameras used in places such as factories which take a long time to install, develop and are difficult to maintain with a clunky user interface. So, I'm planning to research different alternatives, looking at GoPros, PiCameras and even Phones such as the iPhone 11 Pro and evaluate each to find which would be the best to find the best solution to this problem ranked by a number of factors such as the cost, ease to install, ease of maintenace and functionality.</p>
					<p>With the cameras that I'm going to develop, I want them to have functionality in order to be able to do object detection and measure levels of productivity. One solution to this is using Apple's ARKit3 on the iPhone 11 Pros since all the processing can happen without human interaction and on the iPhones themselves.</p>
					
					<h2 id="arm">Robotic Arm</h2>
					<p>This part isn't really relevant to this part of the project, however a few weeks ago, I was working on the robotic arm in the IoT lab of the CSB and trying to figure out how to use it when my plan was to do photogrammetry with the remote cameras. However, I felt that doing this part of the project would be much more beneficial to others such as companies and has alot more business potential than the photogrammetry part of the project as I feel like this is quite a niche in the industrial camera market. </p>
					<p>You can find a guide on how to use the robotic arm in the how to guides part of this blog below, <a href="#how-to">here</a></p>
				
					<h2 id="how-to">How-To Guides</h2>
					<h3>Robotic Arm How-To</h3>
					<p>I created a how-to guide on how to use the robotic arm in the IoT lab of the CSB. I won't be using the robotic arm in this part of the project but I may reference it throughout this blog post, if you want to learn how to use the robotic arm, you can view the guide on my GitHub <a href="http://github.com/RyanStronge/CameraWeb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<h3>GoPro / PiCamera How-To</h3>
					<p>I also created a how-to guide on how to set up the GoPro and PiCamera which I'll be talking about later in this guide. I'll probably reference this guide alot in this blog so it can be found at my GitHub <a href="http://github.com/RyanStronge/CameraWeb" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

					<h2 id="research">Research of Cameras</h2>
					<p>I researched and evaluated different types of cameras that I could use for this, although it was initially designed for the robotic arm, the research still applies to this part of the project.</p>
					<h3>GoPro</h3>
					<p>My initial thought was to use GoPro's because they're small, portable, easy to use and maintain, and well known / have a good reputation. However, they are quite expensive and don't have the best battery life, functionality or zoom compared to other cameras that I could use for the project. Since they were light and small, they would be easy to mount around somewhere like a factory or on a robotic arm (even a robotic arm in the factory!). Also, they'd be easy to create enclosures for to protect them from things such as dust or falling if there was a problem with them due to their portable size and design.</p>
					<p>I did create a web interface for the GoPro that allows any user to easily take photos, videos, turn it on/off, download all photos and change it's resolution. This gives a very easy solution for any user with some technical knowledge to be able to set up the web server by following the how to guide and control the GoPro with a simple user interface. This creates a useful deliverable for other people in the world since it's all open-source and easy to use. The guide on how to do this is above in the how-to guides section above.</p>
					<h3>PiCamera</h3>
					<p>Another option that I had considered were using PiCameras connected to Pi Zeros. Although these are very cheap and portable due to their extremely small form factor, they are difficult to set up, hard to maintain, have a very bad resolution / framerate and can't zoom, making it not viable for this project. Due to their bad resolution and framerate for videos, they wouldn't be able to do object detection from a distance. Also, since they are an exposed circuit board, they'd be quite difficult to create custom enclosures for.</p>
					<p>I also created a web interface for the PiCamera that allows the user to easily take photos and record videos with the PiCamera. I didn't feel the need to add much more functionality because I don't see the PiCameras as a viabe solution other than if a user / client is looking for an extremely affordable solution.</p>
					<h3>iPhone</h3>
					<p>I know the title of this probably sounds crazy, but one of my ideas and the idea I feel is by far the best is to use iPhones such as the iPhone X or iPhone 11. I could use these because the iPhones have a great battery life, have amazing cameras, amazing processing power and have APIs we can use to do things like object detection such as ARKit3. This would also make it much easier to install and maintain, making the installation process near-enough instant since you just have to download the app and set it up. The only downside of this that I can think of right now is that the iPhones are quite expensive. We would also be able to quite easily make an enclosure for this, however we may have challenges producing them at scale.</p>
					<p>I feel like this is the best solution as it would work the best due to the fact that the camera is amazing and I would be able to do all the data analysis etc. on the iPhone itself.</p>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>In conclusion, I feel that the iPhone method will work best. However, all these methods will have a lasting impact in QUB as well as for software developers around the world that are looking for a simple web interface or API to use the GoPro and PiCamera that I'll explain below.</p>


					<h2 id="interface">Creating the Web Interfaces</h2>
					<h3>GoPro Web Interface</h3>
					<p>I created a GoPro web interface so that any user could easily remotely control the GoPro using my how-to guide. If a user has any technical knowledge they'd be able to easily install everything needed for it. To createa the web interface, I used Flask with Ajax in HTML to call python scripts on the Raspberry Pi Zero that was connected to the GoPro via WiFi and connected to a Pi 3B which is the web server is run on. This creates alot of lasting value as it's very modular and open-source meaning other users and students in the future can improve upon it. The web interface includes functionality to take photos, videos, turn it on/off, download all photos / videos taken and change the resolution. I tried to implement livestreaming into the GoPro side of it, but couldn't work out how to in the end after hours upon hours of researching and trying different methods. I decied to give up because I felt my time would be more useful doing other parts of the future and produce more lasting impact.</p>
					<h3>PiCamera Web Interface</h3>
					<p>I also created a PiCamera web interface (on the same website as the GoPro one) so that any user could also easily remotely control the PiCamera as a more affordable solution to the GoPro, making it more available anad useuful to a greater number of students. Due to the low resolution and lower number of features of the PiCamera, I only added taking photos and videos to the web interface, however I implemented a live feed of the PiCamera into this part of the web interface. The code behind this part of the project is mostly the same as the GoPro part, except the PiCamera is directly connected to the Pi Zero using a serial cable.</p>
					<h3>Validation</h3>
					<p>I added validation to the web interface as well to make it easier to use and more user friendly for users that don't have much technical knowledge so that it provides error messages on screen such as if the GoPro / PiCamera is not connected or the WiFi network is incorrect etc. This creates even more of a lasting impact with this project.</p>
					
					<h2 id="ios">Creating iOS Apps</h2>
					<h3>Evaluating Programming Languages</h3>
					<p>I had to decide whether to develop my iOS app for the iPhone remote controlling using Objective-C or Swift. After researching using articles such as <a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/mobile/swift-vs-objective-c-a-look-at-ios-programming-languages/">this </a>and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2920333/swift-vs-objective-c-10-reasons-the-future-favors-swift.html">this</a>, I decided that Swift would be the best option because it's more modern, has better peformance and is easier to implement APIs that I may need such as ARKit 3. I need the best possible performance since I'm going to be doing alot of machine learning and object detection. Since it's an iOS app I'm making for this at this point, Swift would be the best to use since it's by Apple themselves and it's alot easier to learn than Objective-C.</p>
					<p>To code in Swift, I had to download XCode which was very easy to install and use.</p>
					<h3>Learning Swift</h3>
					<p>To learn Swift, I used a number of different articles and YouTube videos that can be found here: </p>

					<p>I also used the <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/" target="_blank">swift documentation</a></p>
					<p>I found swift quite challenging ot learn at first because it is a strange combination between Java and Python in terms of the syntax in my opinion. However, after alot of trial and error using the Playground feature on XCode (download XCode <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">here</a>). If I was ever stuck on any points in it, I would re-reference the documentation above, or look up my issue on a website such as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a></p>
			
					<h2 id="github">GitHub Repository</h2>
					<p>All the code that I have produced so far can be found in my GitHub repository that can be found <a href="https://github.com/RyanStronge/CameraWeb">here</a></p>
					<p><br>The <strong>RemoteCam</strong> folder contains the GoPro and PiCamera web interfaces as well as the web server files. <br> The <strong>how-to-guide</strong> and <strong>how-to-guide gopro</strong> contains the robotic arm how-to webpage and the gopro web interface how-to guide respectively.</p>
					<p>I'll regularly update this GitHub repository so my latest version of my software is always on it to ensure it is as useful and accessible as possible to myself and other students / consumers who could use the software for photography (the web interface parts) or use the code to help students implement something like this into their own systems.</p>

					<h2 id="impact">The Lasting Impact</h2>
					<p>I feel like the work I've done in this project has created a large amount of lasting impact for many different types of people that I'll list below; </p>
					<p><strong>Students</strong> - I feel like this project is going to have the biggest lasting impact on other students for all parts of this project. Firstly, for the GoPro and PiCamera web interfaces, especailly the code for this would be particularly useful since the API I've designed to work remotely would enable other students to be able to easily pick it up and implement it into their program with relative ease, along with the how-to guide on how to use the web interface and it's code which is published on my GitHub. Also, the robotic arm how-to guide would be very useful to other students wanting to learn how to use the robotic arm since there isn't any proper documentation for the arm other than my how-to guide. Finally, the work I'm doing with object detection and machine learning using the iPhones will be very useful to other students that are looking to go into the same area since I may not get the project finished, but I'll probably work on it over the summer aswell.</p>
					<p><strong>Photographers</strong> - Another potential use of this project, especially for the web interface part would be creating a web interface to allow photographers to view the constant feed of their cameras since I could modify it to work with DSLRs as well as GoPros and PiCameras, for example when they're creating a timelapse, they could see what's happening on the camera at any time on any device connected to the network with this method. Also, if photographers are trying to do photogrammetry, they could use the robotic arm and the how-to guide for it along with the mount I've made with it to attach the GoPro to learn how to use the arm and perform photogrammetry.</p>
					<p><strong>QUB / QLabs</strong> - With all of the work I've done so far, it could be very useful to all students doing Computer Science or students that are in QLabs. Also, the iPhone part of the project has great business potential such as lisencing the product to clients eg. factories to generate money that could be used to fund QLabs to make more projects like this one. </p>
					
					<h2 id="next">What's Next?</h2>
					<p><strong>Develop a Web Server for the iPhone System </strong>- I'm going to develop a web server for the iPhone system so that I can easily access the constant feed of the iPhone and remotely control it from a web inteface. This also opens up opportunities to implement APIs such as TensorFlowJS as an alternative to ARKit2/3. This could be useful to other software developers and studnets if they're looking for a minimal web server to remotely control an iPhone.</p>
					<p><strong>Gather Data for Object Detection / Quality Control </strong>- One of the uses of this system is to do quality control of items going through a conveyer belt, for example is a spray has been applied to a tin correctly. We could use Mechanical Turk for this to find the quality of the spray on tins etc as an affordable solution to expensive data gathering solutions. This could be done for any types of products that quality control needs to be performed on since Mechanical Turk is very fast and affordable. By creating these data sets, these could be very useful to others looking for an object detection data set to train their machine learning algorithim.</p>
					<p><strong>Object Detection with ARKit 2/3 </strong>- I'm also going to attempt to do object detection with the iPhone cameras using the Apple's ARKit API so that I could detect the speed of items going through a factory or the productivity levels of workers in a factory, however this could come with ethical issues such as workers not wanting to be recorded. By creating this system, this would be very useful to factories to help improve production and productivity levels as well as useful to students who are interested in object detection and working with new, exciting technologies such as ARKit.</p>
